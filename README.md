A simple Android app that demonstrates Breadth-First Search algorithm.
I have created this project for a graduate algorithms course I'm taking at university.

This is the initial release; unhandled exceptions in the code will be fixed and some improvements will be done in a future release.
Please note that I've created this project to run on my Galaxy Tab 10.1 (Android 4.0.4); modifications such as changing Android API level or changing sizes of elements displayed on screen may be required to run this project properly on your device.
